It details various documents like bills of lading (crucial legal contracts specifying carrier and shipper duties), freight bills (carrier invoices), and freight claims (documents for notifying carriers of delivery issues).  It also discusses shipment consolidation to reduce costs and concepts like demurrage and detention (penalties for delayed railcar or truck release).  The document covers shipment planning, control, loading, unloading, and tracking.\n\nThe second PDF, `Open_Source_Software_Best_Practices_and_Supply_Chain_Risk_Management.pdf`, is about open-source software,  its risks, and best practices including the use of Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs).  This PDF contains a list of citations related to open-source software, vulnerability management, and risk assessment.
